{"id": "GO-2020-0009", "description": "On 32-bit platforms an attacker can manipulate a ciphertext encrypted with AES-CBC with HMAC such that they can control how large the input buffer is when computing the HMAC authentication tag. This can can allow a manipulated ciphertext to be verified as authentic, opening the door for padding oracle attacks.", "title": null, "aliases": ["CVE-2016-9123", "GHSA-3fx4-7f69-5mmg"], "severity": null, "cvss_v3_score": null, "cvss_v3_vector": null}
