If django.utils.text.Truncator's chars() and words() methods were passed the html=True argument, they were extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs due to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in a regular expression. The chars() and words() methods are used to implement the truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template filters, which were thus vulnerable.", "title": null, "aliases": ["CVE-2018-7537"], "severity": null, "cvss_v3_score": null, "cvss_v3_vector": null}
